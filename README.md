> **“Crystal Plasticity-Based Grain-Scale Failure Prediction Driven by Engine Operating Conditions using Virtual Sensing and Machine Learning”**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To simulate how real-world engine inputs (like throttle position) lead to internal deformation and failure at the grain level in a metallic component. The project combines a full-field crystal plasticity finite element simulation (CP-FEM) of a microstructural RVE with a macro-scale simulation of a real engine component. Virtual sensor signals (e.g., strain, slip, stress) are extracted and analyzed using machine learning to predict grain-scale failure.

| **Macro-Scale FEM**               | Simulated engine component (e.g., piston crown, valve seat) using mechanical loading derived from TPS              |

## 🏗️ **Workflow Summary**

### **PHASE 1: Microstructural Simulation (CP-RVE)**

* Generate 2D grain-resolved mesh (Voronoi)
* Assign Euler angles (orientations) to grains
* Use existing CP material model (e.g., DAMASK, MOOSE)
* Apply cyclic or transient loading (from TPS profile)
* Compute stress, plastic slip, and failure maps

### **PHASE 2: Macro-Component Simulation**

* Choose simplified engine geometry (e.g., piston ring sector)
* Apply mechanical loading derived from TPS profile
* Extract strain/stress signals from virtual sensors
* Use signals to inform or cross-validate CP-RVE

### **PHASE 3: Signal Processing & Feature Extraction**

* Extract ε(t), σ(t), $\gamma(t)$, dσ/dt from grains
* Compute features: mean, std, peak, PSD
* Label failure using accumulated slip thresholds

### **PHASE 4: Machine Learning Prediction**

* Prepare feature/label dataset: `[features] → [slip/failure]`
* Train model (RandomForest, MLP)
* Predict failure risk from input profiles or signal patterns
* Validate accuracy with test data

## 🧠 **How to Explain to Your Supervisor**

> “My PPP project proposes a multiscale digital twin framework where engine control inputs like throttle position are used to simulate mechanical loading on an engine component. I model the resulting deformation both at the macro-scale and inside a grain-resolved CP-RVE. I extract virtual sensor signals (strain, stress, plastic slip), analyze them using PSD and feature extraction, and train machine learning models to predict internal failure. This setup mimics how digital twins might work in real applications, linking sensor data to grain-level damage prediction.”
